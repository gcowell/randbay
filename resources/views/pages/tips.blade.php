                <h2>Tips for Buyers</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>1) Be Curious - Embrace the Random</h3>
                <p>This is the whole point of Randbay - If you get some music, listen to it. If you get a book, read it. New experiences are great!</p>
                <h3>2) Be Shrewd - Play the Game</h3>
                <p>Frequently you might buy something at a bargain price. If you think you can, why not sell it on at a higher price? Hustle.</p>
                <h3>3) Be Relaxed - Don't take it personally</h3>
                <p>Don't be too dissatisfied if you end up with something that is not to your taste. Its all in the luck of the draw!</p>
                <h3>4) Be Restrained - Don't Gamble</h3>
                <p>There are always a handful of highly valuable items being sold on Randbay, but don't gamble your money away trying to find them - randomness always wins!  </p>
                <h3>5) Be Social - Share your Purchases</h3>
                <p>If you get something super-cool, share it on social media for others to see. Maybe keep it to yourself if you get something mega lame. Secrets!</p>

                <h2>Tips for Sellers</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>1) Be Random - Sell in the Spirit of Randbay</h3>
                <p>Don't just sell junk trying to catch people out. Our sneaky algorithms will quickly find you! Sell things that will make the buyer laugh, or interesting things that they otherwise might not come across.</p>
                <h3>2) Be Creative - Advertise you Skills</h3>
                <p>Sell things you made. Music, art, games, stories - whatever! It gives you exposure for your craft and can make you money at the same time!</p>
                <h3>3) Be Environmental - Recycle Old Stuff</h3>
                <p>Got some stuff you don't need, but might not be able to sell conventionally? Some old LPs or books? Sell them on here and make money whilst saving the planet (kind of).</p>
                <h3>4) Be Sensible - Set Appropriate Prices</h3>
                <p>Don't just try to rip buyers off, or you Randbay career will be very short lived. Spooky eyes are watching...</p>
                <h3>5) Be Global - Sell to the World</h3>
                <p>Randbay buyers are all over the world - why not sell local delicacies or souvenirs. You could even add a handwritten note in your native language! </p>
